## Introduction:
 This is a game developed with Unity, which uses C#. The purpose of this game is to be used as a teaching tool. Players explore different career paths and learn how to better prepare for interviews. Although this game is designed with the assumption that the player is a US armed forces veteran, its not restricted for veteran use only. Anyone can use this tool to improve their interviewing skills. This tool is an ongoing senior design project developed by college students for a non-profit organization.

### Important Notes:
- Because this project has large files (mostly videos), Git LFS is required. **This causes problems when trying to host the game to play on WebGL**. Also, Player Results are stored in a directory created in the root of the project. **Changing this project to WebGL would require an overhaul of the player results file implementation**. There is a WebGL branch  that can be cloned and played locally in a web browser with WebAssembly.
